# :speaking_head: About
> Welcome to cub3d, a journey into the world of raycasting, where 3D visuals come to life through fundamental computer graphics techniques. This project, created during my time at the prestigious 1337 School, dives deep into the intricacies of raycasting, enabling immersive environments with elegant simplicity. In cub3d, we explore the mechanics behind raycasting—a technique that projects rays from a virtual eye to map a 3D perspective onto a 2D screen.
  It’s the engine behind many early 3D games and remains relevant for understanding the basics of 3D rendering. This project builds a functional raycasting engine, transforming 2D map data into 3D spaces with walls, textures, and lighting effects, creating a compelling visual experience.
